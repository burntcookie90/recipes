# Recipe
## Levain 
(10-15min active, 5-6 hour wait)
1. Mix together [levain](#levain-formula) ingredients
2. Leave somewhere 74-76F for 5-6 hours. Done when expanded, bubbly on top and sides, smell a little sour


## Autolyse 
(10-15min active, 1hour wait)
1. Mix together [dough](#dough-formula) ingredients **but reserve 50g water for later**. Make sure all dry bits are hydrated
2. Store somewhere warm (near the levain is great!) for 1 hour

## Mix 
(10-15min)
1. Add salt, reserved water from [autolyse](#autolyse) step, and [levain](#levain)
2. Transfer to a tub or thick walled bowl for bulk fermentation. Final dough temp should be around 78F

## Bulk Fermentation
(4 hours)
1. Perform 3 sets of [folds](#folds) spaced out by 30 minutes
2. Once 3 sets of folding is complete, allow to rest for remainder of bulk fermentation time.

## Divide/Preshape
(5min, 25min wait)
1. Turn dough out of bowl onto lightly floured surface
2. Divide dough into two halves with a bench knife
3. Lightly flour other hand (first hand has the bench knife!), use both the knife and your hand turn each half of dough on the coutner while lightly pulling the dough towards you and make rounds

## Shape
(10min, 5 min rest)
**This section is for one dough round at a time!**
1. Lightly flour the top of your dough rounds and work surface
2. Flip the dough round so the floured top is now face down on the work surface
3. Lightly stretch the bottom of the round and then up and over about 2/3 to the top of the round
4. Grab the left and right sides of the dough and stretch them away from each other [(like quite a bit)](https://149349705.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/theperfectloaf-beginners-sourdough-bread-15-1.jpg). Fold one side over toward the other and repeat with the other side
5. Grab the top of the circle and stretch away from yourself, fold down over to the bottom of the resting dough.
6. Flip or roll down the dough so the seams are on the bottom
7. Using two hands: cup the top part of the round and drag the dough gently towards yourself. This will make a skin.
8. Rest the dough for a few minutes
9. Place seam side up in a towel-lined and flour dusted kitchen bowl

## Rest and Proof
(16 Hours)
1. Place dough bowls in plastic bags
2. Rest on counter for **20min**
3. Place in refridgerator for **16 hours**


## Bake
(1hr preheat, 50min bake, 1-2hour wait)
1. Place dutch oven in oven and preheat oven to 500F 1 hour before baking
2. Once preheating is complete: Take dough bowl out of fridge. Put a piece of parchment paper over the top of the bowl so it is covered. Invert onto pizza peel.
3. Score the loaf (however you want)
4. Place into dutch oven, turn oven down to 475F, bake for **20min**
5. After 20 min have passed, remove top from dutch oven. Turn oven down to 450F, bake for **30 min**. Internal temp should be over 208F
6. Remove from dutch oven and cool on wire rack for 1-2hours
7. If baking second loaf: replace covered dutch oven into oven and bring temp back to 500F
